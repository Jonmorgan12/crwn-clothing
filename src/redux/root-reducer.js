// Reducers are a pure function in Redux. Pure functions are predictable. Reducers are the only way to change states in Redux. It is the only place where you can write logic and calculations. Reducer function will accept the previous state of app and action being dispatched, calculate the next state and returns the new object.

import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import { persistReducer } from "redux-persist";
//I want to use local storage
import storage from "redux-persist/lib/storage";

import userReducer from "./user/user.reducer";
import cartReducer from "./cart/cart.reducer";
import directoryReducer from "./directory/directory.reducer";
import shopReducer from "./shop/shop.reducer";

const persistConfig = {
  key: "root",
  storage,
  whitelist: ["cart"],
};

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  user: userReducer,
  cart: cartReducer,
  directory: directoryReducer,
  shop: shopReducer,
});

export default persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer);
